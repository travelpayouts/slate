# Hotels search API

## Requirements for Hotels API access

1. Each search query must be initiated by the user and the results must be shown to the user in full. The results for each query must contain a “buy” button next to each flight option.
2. The conversion rate for searches via the Buy link must be 9% or more. The conversion rate from the Buy button to actual purchases must be at least 5%.
3. We'll also need to see the URL of your project, your design prototypes, a description of your project and how our API will be used. 

## Hotels search API description

With hotels API, a partner can create his or her own search of hotels. Access to the hotel search API is free, limited, and available on an individual basis on request from the partner.

**To access the search API hotels**, submit your request to support@travelpayouts.com with the following information:

* URL of your website.
* Design prototypes of search result and hotel's page.
* How you will use the search API?
* Why aren’t the standard methods of integration (search forms, White Label, API access to data) suitable for you?

**Attention, please**! Data about Booking.com is missing in the API of hotels. The reason for this is the policy of the company to work through the API and White Label.

## Search management

Search by hotel IATA-code or cityId (ID location), or hotelId (ID hotel). All options or just one can be specified. If you specify hotelId and cityId, only hotelId will be used. If you specify iata and cityId, iata will be used.

When using this search, it is possible to access its results not immediately, but after a period of time not exceeding 15 minutes. Handling is on the request ID searchId.

**Attention**! The default number of requests is limited to **200 requests per hour** for one IP address. If you need to process more requests, send a note to support@travelpayouts.com.
